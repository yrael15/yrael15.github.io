            <h2>Belladonna (she/they)</h2>
            <p>Look out, baddies, double trouble is here and it looks like the singular form of Belladonna. The second most senior member of Bloom loves uplifting and supporting the team as a unified front, a joining of a human and supernatural consciousness into one beautiful being. They fight with a weapon made of light, most notably in the form of a spiked baseball bat, and have a zero tolerance policy toward evildoers and AI.</p>

            <h2>Daffodil
              (she/they)</h2>
            <p>Famous for her bright makeup and signature aerial stunts, not much else is actually known about this addition to our local magical girl team. Daffodil joined Bloom just over a year ago, and their ribbon whip and daring flips have been a staple in the team’s battles ever since. While she may not have the most personal KOs under her belt, her fighting style lends to a remarkable number of assists. Whether the rumours surrounding her involvement with teammate Larkspur are true or not remains to be confirmed, but Daffodil has made no public claims to deny the relationship.</p>

            <h2>Larkspur
              (she/her)</h2>
            <p>Often seen jumping from dream-portal to dream-portal, Larkspur is Bloom’s most senior member, having worked with Lily for 2 years before her death. Utilizing a mixture of reality-bending magic and precise bladework, she is often spotted in the thick of combat during Bloom’s battles. Her quick reaction time has led some to speculate she can see the future in some form. Rumor has it Larkspur and Daffodil are romantically involved.</p>

            <p>Wielder of the Purple Flame, Wolfsbane was once an agent of evil until the magical girl Lily was able to save him, bringing him to Bloom. Being an artificial human, Wolfsbane’s magical powers are not as strong as the rest of the team and instead relies on a power suit and motorcycle created by using advanced magi-tech. He is not known for subtly.</p>

            <p>Zeke's super power is being super… friendly! This ordinary magic girl is a Jack of All Trades, though it could be said they are a master of one thing in particular: hyperfixating on the coolest new interest! He loves learning something NEW, but can often times get himself in trouble trying to do things outside their capabilities.</p>

          <p>Lily was a patient, watchful Guardian, known for protecting with kindness and self-sacrifice. Her calming presence and magical shield defended against deadly threats. Oliva Bay saw her as a beacon of hope, fiercely defending the town from darkness with unwavering courage. Lily’s code and dedication made her a respected Guardian, always keeping others on the right path. She is sorely missed.</p>
