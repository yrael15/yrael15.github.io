Episode 3, On the Run
00;00;05;27 - 00;00;15;06
Candace
You're listening to Bloom and Blight, Episode Three, On the Run.
 
00;00;15;06 - 00;00;49;06
Taylor
Y'all are able to jump through easy enough and make your way to the Gardening Club where we'll just kind of pick up the action there. As you know, like we said, summertime, very light in in terms of actual college students roaming around or anything like that. You have, you know, basically access to this this room, we'll say like little key card or something of the sort to be able to to get in as it's, you got to take care of the plants even during the summer.
 
00;00;49;06 - 00;01;05;12
Taylor
Otherwise what's the point of Gardening Club? They'd all be dead. So you're able to badge in just fine and I guess explain, explain to our audience kind of what the purpose is and what y’all are looking for here.
 






00;01;05;12 - 00;01;31;23
Kit
The way that Bloom is sort of connected outside of being Bloom, right, Is is this sort of on campus gardening club situation, which Daf is notoriously missing from. Daf does not really, to most folks' knowledge, have any connection to the campus. So it would be as far as she is told anybody, it would be weird, frankly, if I was in the gardening club, I don't even go here.
 
00;01;33;08 - 00;02;10;14
Kit
So I think it's a very a very like tense look around coming into this gardening club fully in a mask, like a very weird situation. But so the the hideout is very particular in how you can get in. And so we sort of have to, you know, show up to this this gardening club, because in order to get into a little hideout thing, as I recall, the mechanics of it, we need some sort of representation of our transcendence and for Bloom, that is our flowers.
 
00;02;11;11 - 00;02;29;19
Kit
So the gardening club sort of exists as “A” a cover story and “B” a means to have access to those sort of always at the ready. I don't know. Do we have do do we grow daffodils in this gardening club? Do y'all do that? Because I think Daf probably keeps some at her house.
 






00;02;30;04 - 00;02;37;26
Anna
I think Larkspur would, because Larkspur does know that you go here. She's the only one who does.
 
00;02;38;04 - 00;02;48;22
Kit
That's that is actually a very good point. Is Larkspur in costume? I think we establish that Larkspur is is pretty clearly Larkspur at the moment.
 
00;02;49;08 - 00;02;49;24
Anna
Yes.
 
00;02;50;09 - 00;03;05;18
Kit
Okay. So it would be weird if I was not, cool. Awesome. So the mask stays on. Just because it is very odd that to mask figures are showing up to gardening club but it's after hours. It's summer. We don't really we don't need to answer to anybody. Right, right god?
 




00;03;05;18 - 00;03;09;12
Anna
If anybody comes, we’ll slip through a daydream. It's fine.
 
00;03;10;05 - 00;03;16;10
Taylor
Definitely be a lot of those on a college campus. Yeah, in the middle of a boring lecture.
 
00;03;17;21 - 00;03;18;14
Kit
Summer classes.
 
00;03;18;15 - 00;03;44;13
Taylor
But yeah. So y'all are, you know, in this in this gardening club with, you know, all of your flowers, but various others flowers, herbs, vegetables, you know, there's other other things kind of in here to make it not so obvious that there's just flowers that associate with this magical girl crew here. As you know, you're you've got it's summertime.
 




00;03;44;22 - 00;04;14;06
Taylor
You've got all sorts of squash and tomatoes and peppers all kind of growing. I feel like there's probably a bit of a sprinkler system that is is set and turns on as you all are kind of going through and you're able to pick your particular flowers. Is there anything else here other than just kind of gathering equipment or the needs that you would want to do before heading to the hideout or anything else in town that the two of you want to do before heading to the hideout?
 
00;04;17;00 - 00;04;43;04
Kit
I do think it's very rare the occasion that Daf actually shows up at this greenhouse. I'm sure it's happened before, but it's weird for that to happen. So I think there is kind of like a a squint at like the small pot of daffodils in the corner and just sort of like a squint. And a look at Lark, and like, just like fighting the goofiest smile, but she doesn't say anything.
 
00;04;43;20 - 00;04;46;08
Anna
You could join the club. I don't think anyone would notice.
 
00;04;46;25 - 00;04;52;24
Kit
I, it's like there's literally so few members.
 
00;04;52;24 - 00;04;57;00
Anna
I mean, there's more now. None of your teammates are in the club, as far as I know.
 
00;04;57;19 - 00;04;58;03
Taylor
Yeah.
 
00;04;59;03 - 00;05;00;03
Kit
But our.
 
00;05;00;03 - 00;05;00;27
Taylor
Teammates.
 
00;05;00;27 - 00;05;03;09
Kit
Are. I can. I can.
 
00;05;03;09 - 00;05;03;26
Taylor
Be.
 
00;05;05;02 - 00;05;08;20
Kit
A face in the crowd. I don't know if I can be a face in the club that you
 
00;05;08;20 - 00;05;09;28
Taylor
Guys go to every week.
 
00;05;10;26 - 00;05;15;23
Kit
I think, they're not idiots, Syb. They're going to catch on.
 
00;05;16;04 - 00;05;25;24
Anna
Okay, I'm not going to push it. I just. I feel bad and I'm always looking for an excuse to see you.
 
00;05;25;28 - 00;05;45;18
Kit
I. You, I know, I, I don't know. I just want to be able to keep doing this with you guys. And if people start finding out, this is better than having to choose.
 
00;05;46;27 - 00;05;51;15
Anna
I know. And I'm going to protect your secret. Don't worry.
 
00;05;52;08 - 00;05;54;09
Kit
I am sorry.
 
00;05;54;09 - 00;05;57;10
Anna
It's fine. Do you have the flowers? 
 
00;05;58;09 - 00;06;32;09
Kit
Hmmmm. Daf knows it is not fine, but we're just going to shove that deep down and ignore it and pretend it is. But yeah, she sort of, you know, holds up a very mismatched bunch of notably poisonous flowers. I don't know that we've really ever mentioned that fact, pointed that out. But, yeah, just, you know, the the weird and poisonous flowers of the greenhouse just in a goofy little bunch like, is this good?
 
00;06;32;09 - 00;06;42;28
Kit
Did I miss? I don't think I missed anybody. Just out of habit has also picked a lily, just sort of not even realizing that, like, that's happened. It's just, you know, going down the list.
 
00;06;43;22 - 00;06;52;18
Anna
Oh, we should get back. I don't want them waiting too long. I know Belladonna is there, but there’s no telling what will Wolfsbane will do.
 
00;06;53;09 - 00;06;53;28
Kit
Very true.
 
00;06;54;03 - 00;06;57;12
Anna
He wanted to, suggested that we kill the kid earlier. So.
 
00;06;57;24 - 00;07;03;05
Kit
Yeah, we're not going to tell Belladonna that, right? Like, we're not. We're going to. I mean,
 
00;07;03;12 - 00;07;05;05
Anna
No, I think that just stays between us.
 
00;07;05;19 - 00;07;17;27
Kit
Okay. All right. Yeah. We should hurry up before that, actually, and she’ll just ust reach out and grab, grab like, Lark’s hand. Like, lead the way.
 
00;07;18;26 - 00;07;22;22
Anna
I will rip us into another daydream. We'll make our way across town.
 
00;07;23;10 - 00;07;48;11
Taylor
Okay. Yeah. You're able to kind of hop daydream to daydream until you're able to hone in on, you know, the general area that Vic and Belladonna have made it to so far as they are heading towards the hideout. And you're able to kind of start following by popping between apartment buildings and kind of keeping up pace with all of your things.
 
00;07;48;11 - 00;08;22;08
Taylor
Y'all are making your way towards the hideout with, yeah, the fact that Larkspur can literally phase through people's dreams, her and have caught up pretty quickly and y'all can see them kind of bopping along rooftops and such. And then as y’all get a little, little further to the edge of town because I we talked about that your hideout is kind of an underground base that is inside a long dead volcano.
 
00;08;23;03 - 00;09;08;18
Taylor
So guess what? It’s got that good, that good, like nutrient rich soil for all the the floral needs you may have. So, you know, we may have to get a little, little more out of town to kind of get into the foothills and such before you are you're kind of right there at the hideout itself. And while y'all are going, I think that Vic would probably be the first to notice, seeing as Zeke is actively on the bike with you sitting, you feel his hands like move and actually like grip on to the side of you, like your, you know, when you're riding a bike or someone but like hard.
 
00;09;09;10 - 00;09;10;14
Taylor
And then he just starts
 
00;09;10;14 - 00;09;10;23
Taylor
To
 
00;09;10;23 - 00;09;11;21
Taylor
Scream.
 
00;09;12;21 - 00;09;16;14
Logan
Calm down, kid, you're going to be fine if you freak out too much, you'll fall off.
 
00;09;17;15 - 00;09;49;05
Taylor
Still's going. It is almost like you can't understand what he's saying, as it seems like words are trying to come out and you can feel the little like pinpricks of like static electricity again on your on your side. But it's not nearly as strong or anything. But there seems to be this energy kind of coming off of him as well as he is just panic screaming, confused screaming, what's going on?
 
00;09;49;05 - 00;10;28;07
Taylor
Like some of those things. And then you hear something's coming, something's coming, something's coming. And then he screams again in like a panic. And you can feel him kind of slump a little bit. But there's still that static electricity. We’ll say, then that meltdown, you would notice something is going on as your friend is like actively kind of panicking on the back of this bike as you're in pursuit and then you see coming over, kind of one of these we’ll say, we're kind of closer to, general, like houses, some smaller businesses.
 
00;10;28;07 - 00;10;56;03
Taylor
You know, we're not in the high rises or anything anymore. You see what looks to be like a drone. Deep black matte metal. Maybe it's not shining at all and it has this pulsing blue light on the front of it that looks very familiar and it starts to kind of come. And then you see a second one and then a third one.
 
00;10;56;10 - 00;11;24;14
Taylor
That first one kind of hits the ground behind y'all and does just this Mighty Morphin Power Rangers type transformation into what looks to be like a kind of standing Droid type robot. I think the other two y'all are now able to see as you've jumped and you're basically right by one of these drones as it continues off that direction and starts to follow very quickly,
 
00;11;24;14 - 00;11;45;07
Taylor
As quick as this bike is your friends. With that, we don't really have any sort of initiative. And this is kind of like, we go you go, kind of vibe on how we are going to deal with this confrontation. So I leave it up to you first as their move was essentially running after you.
 
00;11;45;07 - 00;11;59;24
Kit
So with Lark sort of, you know, jumping in and out, are you immediately like swiping back into some sort of a dream or are you seeing this and stopping, I guess, sort of affects what the vibe is going to be?
 
00;12;00;22 - 00;12;12;06
Anna
Yeah, noticing this Lark would not swipe into another dream immediately. I think we would land on whatever rooftop is….whatever we are passing.
 
00;12;13;05 - 00;12;38;27
Kit
Daf’s sort of like the hand that is not holding Lark's is holding flowers. So they just sort of like, you know, like look back and forth like, oh, oh, shit. Oh, God. Okay. And I can't let go of the flowers because we need those sort of lets go of Lark's hand like, please don't leave me up here, and a whip materializes in her hand, just a very gold.
 
00;12;39;11 - 00;12;51;02
Kit
It's kind of looks like it's made of more of like ribbons than of like, you know, like rope or something and just sort of like, looks at like like we're. We need to go grab that. Yeah?
 
00;12;51;28 - 00;12;59;03
Anna
Yeah. I don't think those are friendly. And as your whip materializes, Larkspur’s second blade does as well.
 
00;13;00;04 - 00;13;01;00
Kit
I can get you close.
 
00;13;01;15 - 00;13;04;28
Anna
Just be careful. Don't get hurt.
 
00;13;04;28 - 00;13;05;13
Kit
Do you trust me?
 
00;13;06;01 - 00;13;06;22
Anna
You know I do.
 
00;13;08;16 - 00;13;34;02
Kit
Cool. Great. Awesome. The whip sort of. Is it a whip or is it a lasso? It doesn’t, It kind of depends. It sort of, they flick it out into like, I don't know, a tree branch or telephone pole, whatever is like nearby some sort of up high thing that they can swing from. And a hand wraps around Lark’s waist and they jump right off of the building.
 
00;13;34;02 - 00;13;45;17
Kit
The goal kind of being to like swing off and launch Lark towards this thing, because they know, Lark can land. They're not going to like throw her way up in the air, but close enough that she can get within blade reach.
 
00;13;46;11 - 00;13;56;25
Taylor
Love it. What are others doing? As you see this kind of start to you start to see some sort of response from the two that have been bopping around following you.
 




00;13;57;15 - 00;14;29;09
Candace
Belladonna has a has a keychain that they always kind of have on their person and it has like a tiny version of what becomes their weapon, their weapon’s kind of like made of a light material like light. So they kind of like pull it off of their keychain and it turns into like throwing stars and they just release them at each of the drones to try and at least like crack the lens.
 
00;14;29;09 - 00;14;37;07
Candace
If they can't bring it down, they just want to at least kind of make it hard for them to see knowing that we're so close to where we're going.
 
00;14;38;06 - 00;14;54;02
Taylor
Absolutely. So, let’s see, would you like to do that in more of like a Defy way? Are you trying to you to kind of go that direction or do you have another way you would like to maybe use that depending on what points you kind of have? 
 
00;14;54;09 - 00;14;57;21
Candace
Yeah, I think I think in a Defy kind of way.
 
00;14;58;22 - 00;15;00;05
Taylor
Okay.
 
00;15;00;05 - 00;15;07;20
Candace
Because I'm trying really hard to focus in this moment because everyone that I care about is at risk.
 
00;15;08;01 - 00;15;09;13
Taylor
Absolutely.
 
00;15;09;13 - 00;15;10;09
Candace
So I got a one.
 
00;15;11;20 - 00;15;46;29
Taylor
So you kind of turn around, you're on on your your board. You kind of turn your attention towards this thing and start to, you know, go through, grab your kind of keychain and you do the move. But unfortunately, you are on this board going very, very, very quickly. And in the process, you get a little wobbly and you see that this one of the wheels kind of catches on kind of the curb here on the road.
 
00;15;46;29 - 00;16;32;23
Taylor
And you see that one of the drones kind of notices that this is going on and is going to seize this kind of opportunity here as you are starting to, absolutely lose control on your board. And basically you are in the process of falling as this is going, and this drone is going to kind of come up directly at you and almost, almost kind of assist in this fall as you see that just this shock of electricity comes out of this kind of blue orb on the front of this directly at you.
 
00;16;33;14 - 00;16;42;00
Candace
Can I say that even though I failed, it at least kind of sets up my teammates because now the drones are distracted.
 
00;16;42;25 - 00;17;01;19
Taylor
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, they have they are seizing on the opportunity of you. Yeah, I like that. As you are getting attacked and you're about to face plant so fully their attention is on you. What then would Vic like to do before these drones fully enact their term?
 


00;17;02;16 - 00;17;30;13
Logan
I would say the drones made a mistake to try to fight me while I'm on my bike and fully like ready to combat. He swings his bike around and most of his powers come from like the magic that is that he summons from within. But part of it comes from the magic tech that he has literally grafted on his left hand, which is a magic tech, cybernetic hand.
 
00;17;31;03 - 00;17;58;03
Logan
And he puts his hand out far reaching into the air and like a black tube, just like ejects from his hand, and it just kind of floats in the air for a bit for him to grab it and it becomes a massive obsidian scythe. And you can see him like start spinning it around, spinning it and cutting up the cement as he turns his bike and he goes, time to take care of business kids.
 
00;17;58;10 - 00;18;08;15
Logan
And he I'm going to try and swing with Zeke on my back, on my bike at this one of these drones because like, you know, I don't have the ability to target more than one.
 
00;18;08;29 - 00;18;38;16
Taylor
Yeah. You feel Zeke is just, like, gripping in to you has kind of stopped the general panic screaming. But I feel like with the, he's still like, what's going on? What's going on? Like, who are these? What's going on? What are the what is this? Why do I feel something? Something's not right. Something's not right. And, like, has this just, like, buzz about him as you spin and go.
 
00;18;38;16 - 00;18;57;17
Taylor
I will say, because of the general situation that Belladonna finds herself in currently, I will keep you at risky instead of desperate, as it probably most definitely would have been as you have a civilian on your bike with you while you're doing this. But yeah, go ahead and roll what you see fit there.
 
00;18;58;11 - 00;19;02;21
Logan
I mean, Defy all day, every day. Oh, two threes.
 
00;19;02;24 - 00;19;29;17
Taylor
All right, two threes. There is a consequence here, so I will give you the the pick here because I feel like it'd be interesting to see what Vic’s option would be just with the, the character that Victor is. I will give you the option to suffer harm or a complication. The complication would involve the bike and possibly Zeke, The harm,
 




00;19;30;07 - 00;19;44;19
Taylor
You're taking mechanical harm. So would you be in a position where you would try to take the brunt of this or allow maybe more of a bike or the complication to occur?
 
00;19;46;12 - 00;20;05;10
Logan
It's a good question. The drama says hurt, possibly Zeke or the bike, but the part of him that is too proud to let anything of like anything else get hurt but himself, I think he's going to take the harm. Just his pride would not let him do anything else.
 
00;20;05;11 - 00;20;50;24
Taylor
Yeah, absolutely. So as you are kind of going up and starting with to attack with your scythe, obviously this one drone still in drone form is fully on Belladonna, whereas the other one is also. But then there is this little bit larger transformed version of it that is kind of in more humanoid-esque form, still very robotic that you kind of start to go and swipe that and you watch as it just puts up its hand and stops the scythe. And just does this like shove that,
 
00;20;50;24 - 00;21;18;19
Taylor
Just like spins it around and like kind of dislocates the shoulder a little bit for a minute, you know, just like a real just like whoop with it. And you will take one harm with that. Some of the examples which I would say could be could be a couple I will let you kind of kind of decide here we have drained, scared, confused, scraped, bruised, embarrassed are some things.
 
00;21;18;19 - 00;21;22;02
Taylor
So it's it's a little, little like mental harm as well.
 
00;21;23;15 - 00;21;34;25
Logan
I would say of the examples given, unless you have one in particular that you're leaning towards, I would say like not being able to swipe and kill this thing in one blow, he's embarrassed.
 
00;21;35;15 - 00;22;00;14
Taylor
I was kind of I was between bruised or embarrassed. I was like, I feel like I feel like that embarrassed would be the one. Absolutely. So basically you're going to yeah. Put in embarrassed at the one you can take you know multiple or two. I think of each level of these harms obviously if you take a third level one harm that's going to bump it up.
 




00;22;00;14 - 00;22;29;03
Taylor
And so it's going to kind of stack until you clear those out. Now you know, you kind of have essentially this a little bit of a emotional bruise here. And if there is at any point in time that you may need to kind of face that until that harm is cleared, we can there could be a bit of a downgrade to the success of that kind of until you clear that clear harm.
 
00;22;30;01 - 00;23;06;18
Taylor
 Now we have the one drone that is is kind of actively kind of shooting out a electrified laser towards Belladonna who is is in in process of trying to kind of get back control of this board and hopefully not become road rash city do you yeah watch as it kind of like comes in, shoots this this this beam at you. Could you please,
 
00;23;08;02 - 00;23;14;26
Anna
So I haven't gone could I use my action from Daf throwing me to protect Belladonna?
 
00;23;14;26 - 00;23;17;25
Taylor
Yes, actually, you can. I completely forgot. You've not gone.
 
00;23;18;09 - 00;23;30;15
Kit
Yes, because I have a thing that allows me to help without taking stress. So if I can in some way mechanically boost that by flinging Lark places, I would love to do that.
 
00;23;31;00 - 00;23;36;03
Taylor
Yeah. Yeah. So, Lark, what is kind of what are you envisioning here as as you're trying to help in this situation.
 
00;23;36;14 - 00;23;50;01
Anna
Since Daf has flung me, I think Lark kind of just lands in front of Belladonna, swords crossed in front of her and I will try to resist this attack that is coming. 
 
00;23;50;01 - 00;23;50;23
Taylor
Okay. Absolutely.
 




00;23;51;01 - 00;23;52;23
Anna
And you don't take stress for that, right?
 
00;23;53;11 - 00;24;21;02
Kit
It says don't take stress. Tell us how you prepared for the situation. So I think this is this is the end result of a lot of late night covert dates. And by dates, I mean definitely like Lark is a martial artist, Daf is a gymnast. So it is a lot of like goofy sparring, but also like, hey, hey, babe, I want to I've been I've been seeing this, like, sick partner
 
00;24;21;02 - 00;24;26;12
Kit
Flip, do you want do you want it? We could use this, right? Like we could use it. Do you can we. Can I teach you?
 
00;24;27;06 - 00;24;32;19
Anna
Yeah. I think there are a few moves that they've practiced, which is always interesting.
 




00;24;33;05 - 00;24;41;16
Taylor
Go ahead and. Yeah. How would you like to to roll for that. What is kind of the the direction you're wanting to go stat wise and then.
 
00;24;42;04 - 00;24;52;02
Anna
This is resisting just direct violence. So I'd like to roll with Sun. And I have two dots in Sun for my resist rolls.
 
00;24;52;09 - 00;24;54;01
Kit
Does help give you an extra.
 
00;24;54;19 - 00;24;55;11
Taylor
I’d say we could do it.
 
00;24;55;27 - 00;24;58;16
Anna
Yeah. I rolled two sixes, which is a crit.
 
00;24;58;25 - 00;25;00;22
Taylor
That is a critical.
 
00;25;01;12 - 00;25;15;05
Anna
Yeah. So I clear stress and I think on that crit Daf throws Lark directly into the path of this attack and she crosses her blades in front of her and kind of reflects this electric beam away from them.
 
00;25;16;02 - 00;25;57;11
Taylor
I love it. So Belladonna, you watch as just yeah, Lark just comes flying into view and kind of is able to take this this blast and redirect it out of the way. And so now currently your only real concern is balancing on on this this bike in general or this board in general. Whereas then we have the other one that is still in drone form I think has kind of figured out that there is someone else and is actively kind of looking for Daf.
 






00;25;57;11 - 00;26;21;10
Taylor
And I think you'll see is this this light kind of like flashes as it seems to be scanning the general area and is starting to hedge your direction, Daf. And you watch as what is kind of the area that you are currently at after all of y'all's jumping and throwing, where do we find you?
 
00;26;22;20 - 00;26;40;11
Kit
I think so. We've kind of swung down basically from the top of this building, hook on a tree, swing it down. So I think it's she's kind of like swung forward, launched Lark off and then sort of swung back. So she's kind of on this back swing still sort of attached to this tree or telephone pole or what have you.
 
00;26;41;08 - 00;26;47;06
Kit
Just kind of like surveying the situation, seeing where she needs to launch herself next.
 
00;26;47;06 - 00;27;10;28
Taylor
Okay. Love it. So you see that it is actively kind of looking for you. It doesn't seem like it has, you know, a very good direct line of sight. You know, it seems like it is using more like a sonar, mechanical kind of thing here. How would you like to react? And this is it is not actively trying to cause you any harm.
 
00;27;10;28 - 00;27;15;19
Taylor
Do you want to try and hide? Do you want have a certain move you would like to do?
 
00;27;16;24 - 00;27;38;22
Kit
I think if this thing is distracted by me, let's make some noise. Daf is good at being the distraction or, you know, being sneaky if need be. But like, whatever I can do to help these guys is really my goal. So it looks like if I can get three on one over on this other guy, I can distract this first one over here.
 
00;27;38;22 - 00;28;24;03
Kit
That's not a problem. So I think the whip situation is still attached to this this branch thing. And the other end of it that is a handle sort of becomes yet another like whippy end of it. And they sort of launched that at yet another tree. And now we have basically a gymnastics bar and she's like doing, doing her little flips, launching yourself in the air, you know, launching between this and then jumping towards another tree where yet another, you know, like gymnastics ribbon, one of those like aerial ribbons sort of pops up catches, like she's just doing stick flips, being like obnoxious, trying to keep this thing's attention and, you know, avoid it
 
00;28;24;03 - 00;28;27;08
Kit
hitting her if it tries to, but mostly just trying to be loud.
 
00;28;27;20 - 00;28;40;00
Taylor
Could you just, I guess kind of roll maybe Flow seems like the right vibe here. What's, what's a better, better vibe here as you were just trying to make as much attention as possible and it seems to be yeah kind of following.
 
00;28;40;03 - 00;28;58;26
Kit
I'm so I'm going to I'm going to make an argument and you can feel free to say absolutely not. But I think the reason that Daf is making noise is because that seems to be the way to confuse this thing. That seems to be the way to, in reality, Conceal herself, like to hide by making so much noise that it can't tell what's going on.
 
00;28;59;12 - 00;29;12;17
Kit
So I would like to argue for Conceal. I could understand if you say no, but I think it would. I think it would be. That's kind of the angle that she's going for it. It's like I'm trying to be weird about it. 
 




00;29;13;03 - 00;29;21;15
Taylor
Okay, I Could allow it. We've already kind of used some other like things for specifically words to be more actions and stuff to use. So I think, yeah, yeah, they play hand in hand.
 
00;29;21;15 - 00;29;24;17
Kit
Okay. Thank you. A kind of benevolent GM.
 
00;29;27;11 - 00;29;28;28
Taylor
So that is only a two?
 
00;29;29;18 - 00;29;35;12
Kit
Yeah. That's going to be a two and a one so probably not. But we tried you know.
 






00;29;35;13 - 00;29;56;01
Taylor
Yeah, yeah. I would say you are, you're, you know, you are distracting it as it is following you. But you hear just like kind of this general, just like beep, beep, beep to a [beeps quickly] as it seems like it has honed in on you fully and this lightning bolt kind of comes out your direction.
 
00;29;56;01 - 00;29;58;17
Kit
Odd dunk, and they just like a oomph.
 
00;29;59;05 - 00;30;28;10
Taylor
And, but yeah, you, you kind of have that had your direction with the actual risky here let's see it says you know things could badly self harm a complication occurs you end up in a best position or you lose this opportunity. I would say you're losing the opportunity, as instead of distracting it, you have but it has you in the same way.
 
00;30;28;28 - 00;30;30;00
Kit
Okay that’s fair.
 


00;30;31;02 - 00;30;49;01
Taylor
Vic we go back as this this humanoid robot is is now you know, just pushed your attack to the side. Have you fully stopped the bike or are you were you still kind of like trying to drive by while you hit?
 
00;30;50;14 - 00;31;00;09
Logan
If I didn't have Zeke on my back, I probably would have, like, jumped off the bike and tried to strike him. But I can't have someone who's freaking out riding Cerberus. That would be bad.
 
00;31;02;09 - 00;31;07;26
Logan
So I probably after being swung off, kept going.
 
00;31;07;27 - 00;31;38;29
Taylor
Mm hmm. You see, as this, you've passed by a little a little embarrassed at the ease in which it blocked your attack. And you can hear a thudding on the asphalt behind you, this kind of metallic noise as it is running after you all, and it reaches out and it grabs Zeke by the scruff of his shirt and goes to pull him off of the bike.
 
00;31;40;18 - 00;31;49;22
Taylor
Do you have one, either a move you would like to avoid that or are you wanting to just kind of resist or dodge this this attack in general?
 
00;31;51;11 - 00;32;06;26
Logan
I don't have anything special that really, unless I transcended. Okay. You know what? I'm going to do a full transcendence because then I have an ability that will help in this situation. So can I describe that what that looks like?
 
00;32;06;26 - 00;32;08;10
Taylor
Absolutely. Please do.
 
00;32;08;12 - 00;32;33;13
Logan
Okay. So Wolfsbane seeing the hand reached for Zeke, his eyes go wide. He's not wearing his helmet, so I guess he can see his face, his expressions. And he says not today. And he his hand, his mechanical hand, which is holding on to the scythe, starts to glow a deep purple. And you can see flames start to like emit from it.
 
00;32;33;13 - 00;32;57;16
Logan
And please forgive how cheesy this is, but I feel like it needs it. And he says, This hand of mine is howling purple. It's grip tells me to destory evil. And he fully like from his hand, you see, like a digital effect kind of take over his entire body, like he does like a full magical girl transformation. We zoom the camera out.
 
00;32;57;23 - 00;33;32;15
Logan
We're going into like a bright purple lights flashing everywhere in the background. Someone has cell painted, a wolfsbane flower just floating in the distance. And as he floats doing the full spin, the digital like outline kind of goes all over his body, eventually covering his face, his smallish, I kind of gave the description to y'all, but listeners he has like a athletic kind of twinkish frame to himself.
 
00;33;32;15 - 00;34;09;23
Logan
And as he is transforming, not only does he go into like a full Tron meets, werewolf meets, like cyberpunkiness, his body seems to gain muscle mass and now he's gone full werewolf daddy and he is instead of having his normal his head there, it's like a metal wolf's helmet. From the back of the helmet, you see a purple flame erupt like a main and he has at his tailbone a flaming well tail, which I guess right now it is not flaming because that would hurt harm
 




00;34;09;23 - 00;34;43;11
Logan
Zeke, I don't want to hurt the kid. Even the main is like making sure not to burn his face. And Zeke has is probably he's probably fine. Yeah, but Vic is fully transformed on the bike become much larger and this wolf, metallic wolf face that the instead of like eyes he has like a visor because it's a helmet you can see like this flashing purple light where his eyes are. So just two like flashing lights staring at this robot.
 
00;34;43;21 - 00;35;04;03
Logan
And now that I have transcended, I'm going to use one of my actions. And that's this one's mine. What this does, I'm engaging this flow I already have, technically, neither of you may back down until one of you is defeated. While I engage with the foe, only my rival can assist me. Which again, that's Larkspur. Only Larkspur can help this fight.
 
00;35;04;29 - 00;35;10;29
Logan
And the foes, other foes will not interfere. Effectively, we're in a one on one fight now.
 
00;35;11;26 - 00;35;19;22
Taylor
I love this. Did you hop off the bike in the process of this is is Cerberus now driving Zeke?
 
00;35;19;22 - 00;35;50;04
Logan
Yeah okay yeah effectively yeah I would say Cerberus now because there's, there's some kind of it's not, you know, fully sentient. It's very much like a dog, I suppose, loyal and does what I, what I need to do and drives with Zeke. And I'm very much like holding my scythe in both hands like don't you dare. And I don't know if I can then use an action, can I use a transcendent ability and then…?
 
00;35;50;04 - 00;36;19;25
Taylor
I will say yes, because now it's kind of back to just y'all's general turn. I will say, as you do this, you do see, you know, obviously, this this robot has not been able to fully kind of hold on on to Zeke yet. But you do see that there is a little kind of glass or kind of orby bit on its hand, kind of similar to what was on the eye part of the more flying drone.
 
00;36;20;09 - 00;36;41;04
Taylor
And you see a blue light is coming out of it. It's not electric. It almost just looks like a very dull kind of scan of some sort as then it pulls away and it turns off and he will then turn towards you as Yeah, what is your what is your official ability as we go back to all of y’all’s round? Also sorry.
 
00;36;41;09 - 00;36;42;26
Taylor
Did you say you need another action or?
 
00;36;42;26 - 00;36;49;13
Logan
No, I did my transcendence thing. This one's mine. No one can touch him but me. I'm just wondering if I can, like, Defy to, like, try and attack him or is that.
 
00;36;49;13 - 00;36;56;06
Taylor
Yeah, yeah. Because, yeah, this is your turn now. So. Yeah, well, we'll say so. Yeah. You can fully, fully swing into him.
 
00;36;56;06 - 00;37;09;02
Logan
I will say Larkspur can take my place in this fight. They are the only one. So this is fun. I'm going to, of course, Defy, because I always defy things. Five.
 
00;37;09;19 - 00;37;16;19
Taylor
Okay. Five. That is not bad. So, yeah. Explain how, how, how you attack in general here.
 


00;37;18;06 - 00;37;51;07
Logan
There is every time Wolfsbane swings his scythe, there is like a purple flame that seems to erupt from it, even though it doesn't itself is just like obsidian and black and just very sharp. And probably because he's already aware that this thing can stop his swing at a high speed, he's just like, instead of trying to focus on one really powerful swing, he's trying to do multiple ones to try and catch it off guard so that maybe if it constantly blocks him, he can at least get one good swinging because that's what he believes he needs, is that one good swing.
 
00;37;51;14 - 00;38;02;05
Logan
And and I am just going to say to keep myself honest, I do have that harm. So technically, I think my five is a four, which is the same results, same result. So but I just wanted to keep myself honest.
 
00;38;02;08 - 00;38;30;21
Taylor
Perfect. So you yeah. You are kind of swinging and it is very quick, just block block block until, you know, you get you get the motherboard in there a little confused for a second and you're able to get a solid hit on on to this this creature as you just clear cleave it in half so you know just kind of hit that that real skinny skinny bit in the middle where it was just the.
 




00;38;31;11 - 00;38;32;28
Logan
A joint a joint of some kind.
 
00;38;33;06 - 00;39;03;06
Taylor
Hip connectors to the upper body, you know, just a tiny little joint there in the body. And you're able to just absolutely slash it and have probably leaving like a nice little purple singe as as you do so. But you see, once it hits the ground, because there is a complication here or a consequence with the four or five, you see the light kind of goes out and then it blinks.
 
00;39;03;06 - 00;39;14;28
Taylor
Now it starts to grow red. What would anyone else like to do?
 
00;39;14;28 - 00;39;35;28
Candace
I think Belladonna is trying to kind of shake off the hurt from smashing into the pavement, and I don't know if it would be time for them to. I don't know if it would be time for them to like, transform. I feel like maybe it is.
 


00;39;36;08 - 00;39;47;21
Taylor
I mean, you do you you clearly see, you know, that these drones are targeting Zeke who is now panicking on the back of a sentient bike going the opposite direction of y’all.
 
00;39;47;25 - 00;39;57;27
Candace
Yeah I think that Belladonna kind of. Oh actually before I set this up, Wolfsbane, can anybody ride your bike or is it only for you?
 
00;39;58;07 - 00;40;08;09
Logan
Oh, no. Yeah, anyone can ride it. It's, Just, Just remember, it's like, It's like a loyal dog. So don't don't abuse. Please don't hurt Cerberus.
 
00;40;08;15 - 00;40;26;04
Candace
Oh, no. I'm going to say such nice things to it. So I think Belladonna kind of picks themselves up and realizes that this bike is kind of just riding around with this screaming person in the back. Sees that Larkspur and Daffodil kind of have things covered. One of these drones is already down and there might be an explosion.
 
00;40;27;10 - 00;40;50;12
Candace
So I think Belladonna kind of races toward the bike. And as they kind of like meet up to the bike, they kind of like flip their board up underneath their feet and kind of put it behind them as they try to like jump onto the bike. I'd say when they get on top of it, that's probably when their transformation starts.
 
00;40;50;12 - 00;41;20;26
Candace
Normally, if they were just kind of standing there and it was it was going, it would look a little bit more polished. But I think in this moment, there's like a like a glimmer that kind of happens around her and her uniform kind of just, like, blossoms onto her body. Like it comes up kind of from the ground and like, like, blossoms, like, from her feet up to her head rather than the other way.
 
00;41;22;04 - 00;41;47;13
Candace
And you kind of see this kind of black and white costume that's on her. That's a very kind of split. And she's really kind of focused on just trying to get this bike to accept her. And she gets on top and immediately is like, don't worry, you know me, we're friends. We've got this. We're going to keep we're going to keep everyone safe.
 




00;41;47;13 - 00;42;20;01
Candace
Just I'm just just please, let's work together, okay? And attempts to kind of, like, put their foot down and, like, their boot kind of, like, scrapes the ground as they kind of kick off to turn it the opposite direction to see if they can either go pick up their friends or distract these drones a little bit more so that they don't do anything like this other one is doing, which is turning into a horrible bomb that is going to kill everybody.
 
00;42;20;19 - 00;42;56;26
Taylor
Absolutely. Yeah. You are able to hop on and I think all of you kind of see that the two drones that are still up are now looking like. You have kind of turned attention as it seems like some sort of message has gone out from this other one here will say that the one that is closest is definitely you can see turns then its attention kind of towards y’all a little bit with with Belladonna and Zeke on the bike here.
 
00;42;56;26 - 00;43;18;26
Taylor
So for whoever then interacts with these two drones, their attention is not towards you as there is bomb and there is person taking their target on a bike. So you can have kind of this plus one too to help in that. So would either Daf or Lark like to do?
 




00;43;22;01 - 00;43;28;27
Anna
You said earlier that one of the drone shot lightning at Daf. Is that something that happened?
 
00;43;29;03 - 00;43;31;21
Taylor
Yep, yep, yep. 
 
00;43;32;18 - 00;43;35;27
Kit
I'm fine. Don't worry about me. I'm fine, babe. It's cool. I'm good. I'm great.
 
00;43;37;16 - 00;44;07;10
Anna
Trying to think if I want to transcend as well. I think everyone's doing it. Why? Why not? Yeah. So I will also transcend. Larkspur, after she reflects this blow, she kind of slashes her swords down by her side, and they glow for a moment and she drops down into a dream. And the ethereal-ness that she always has in her costume kind of extends to her body as well.
 




00;44;07;10 - 00;44;32;10
Anna
There's almost that haze over her entirety that looks like she's from a dream or in a dream. And as she kind of falls back out of another rip back into this reality, the ribbons and layers on her dress are a little bit longer, a little bit more flowy. There's movement to her clothing, even without a breeze. Everything just seems very ethereal and unreal about her.
 
00;44;32;18 - 00;44;47;24
Anna
As she lands here. And I am going to run and jump and attack the drone that is looking at Belladonna and Zeke. And I'm going to push myself to do that so I can trigger one of my transcendent abilities.
 
00;44;48;07 - 00;44;54;26
Taylor
Okay. Perfect. Do you still need to take the stress on the on the push or does your. Okay, perfect.
 
00;44;55;14 - 00;45;21;26
Anna
I do, yes. I'm sorry to stress and I will defy to attack. And I think as she runs and jumps towards it, she throws one of her knives underneath where Daf is currently and it kind of slices the air and disappears. And Daf, I'm going to briefly remove you from reality to avoid this attack. So you kind of fall into this dream.
 
00;45;21;27 - 00;45;43;23
Anna
You know, I think it's kind of like an abstract tea party. There's a lot of really weird, large stuffed animals moving around, this table and tea set is far too large. But yeah, you fall into this dream momentarily to avoid the electric that was shot at you, as my blade reappears in my hand and I will attack this drone.
 
00;45;44;08 - 00;45;45;02
Taylor
Absolutely.
 
00;45;45;10 - 00;45;48;23
Kit
If you wanted to take me to dinner, you could just ask.
 
00;45;48;23 - 00;45;53;15
Anna
I am glad I rolled three die. There was a six in there. The other two were not good.
 


00;45;53;15 - 00;46;02;04
Taylor
Right? So. Yeah, yeah. What does the actual attack on the drone look like after you've kind of gotten Daf into safety?
 
00;46;02;10 - 00;46;13;27
Anna
I think she runs and kind of plants her foot on the side of a sign and leaps up into the air and with both blades comes down on top of this drone and it drives it into the ground, if I can.
 
00;46;14;13 - 00;46;37;11
Taylor
Yeah, absolutely. With your being momentum you've got going on, it is fully focused in on on the other two, you are able to like bring it down and you see sparks, you know, flying up, but you're able to kind of withstand any of the volts that might have actually hit you as you see a little bit of smoke coming up.
 
00;46;37;11 - 00;46;44;00
Taylor
But the light on this one has just gotten off fully dark. How long did Daf stay in dreamland?
 


00;46;45;02 - 00;46;59;27
Anna
It just as briefly, it's very vague. So I think I don't want to take Daf out of the fight. So it's just long enough for the attack to miss. And then another rip opens underneath her and she kind of falls through again, kind of in a similar spot where she was.
 
00;47;00;24 - 00;47;04;16
Taylor
So Daf, you come back out to this.
 
00;47;05;02 - 00;47;19;15
Kit
I like to imagine the this sort of like tightrope situation that she had set up does not disappear. There's just like a rift under her appears and she's like, yeah, that's fair. And dives into it, comes back and lands right back on the tightrope where she was. Gives a thumbs up.
 
00;47;19;29 - 00;47;29;23
Taylor
Absolutely. What would you like to do is there's just one singular drone. It has its back to you currently after it's shot and turned around.
 


00;47;30;09 - 00;47;51;29
Kit
I feel a little bit left out because everybody, everybody's transcending. All the cool kids are doing it. And I am nothing if not a follower. So I do think she lands on this this sort of like tightrope situation that she's set up and doesn't like stick the landing. She, like, uses it to bounce off and like towards this one that has sort of like turned around from her.
 
00;47;52;03 - 00;48;16;18
Kit
And I think as she sort of like flipping in the air, there's like this this whip/ribbon situation that she's kind of been manipulating to like fling herself all over the place, cocoons her a little bit, and then spits her back out. And she is, for all intents and purposes, if a if a flower could look like a clown that's kind of the vibe that's happening.
 
00;48;16;26 - 00;48;56;19
Kit
It's very like the stripey long socks. And there's like also like this like stripey arm warmers, like it's like a gymnast situation, but it's very like there's clown elements. There's like the little, like frilly collar, right? The the sort of like mundane little like brown hair situation is gone. It is bright neon orange pigtails. And she sort of like launches out of this this like high speed transformation because you don't really have time to mess around and we'll try to like land on top of this thing peaks down to sort of like bend over and like her face is upside down in front of whatever quote unquote face this thing has.
 


00;48;56;19 - 00;49;02;25
Kit
And she just sort of says, eyes on me, sunshine and like, decks it like, I'm just going to take this thing and shove it into the ground.
 
00;49;02;25 - 00;49;10;13
Taylor
Absolutely. Do you have a certain move or are you just wanting to defy or a general, general attack?
 
00;49;10;26 - 00;49;26;09
Kit
I do have kind of a transcendent ability that if I can push myself, which I think doing the sort of transformation while mid launch may qualify as pushing myself, I can choose to perform a superhuman feat of athletics which feels appropriate.
 
00;49;26;23 - 00;49;35;18
Taylor
So yeah, so you can go and push yourself, you can have an additional die and you have the plus one from Belladonna helping to set up there as well. So.
 


00;49;35;29 - 00;49;40;19
Kit
So yeah, I think I don't, Defy, maybe Flow is a vibe.
 
00;49;41;02 - 00;49;43;08
Taylor
Flow feels very much Daf's vibe.
 
00;49;44;14 - 00;49;47;03
Kit
Excellent. Sick. Gnarly.
 
00;49;48;01 - 00;49;49;13
Taylor
Nice. Okay, so a.
 
00;49;49;13 - 00;49;49;29
Kit
Lot of dice.
 
00;49;50;11 - 00;49;56;11
Taylor
A lot of dice. Yeah. With the six, would you explain how you do it, how it just works.
 
00;49;57;10 - 00;50;30;24
Kit
Yeah. So she she sort of does this transformation in the air, lands on this thing and sort of hanging over the edge of it has her her zesty little quip and then just sort of like goes to like handspring off of it. But instead of launching herself, she's launching this thing down. So I don't know that she necessarily does like the sickest of flips, but she's trying to basically like, fuck like volleyball spike this thing into the ground using like the sort of same acrobatic maneuvers that would normally launch her up, just trying to just run it into the ground and shatter it, honestly.
 
00;50;31;01 - 00;51;02;16
Taylor
Wonderful. Yeah. You are able to just mush this thing to the ground, you see just like pieces of metal and sparks are all kind of like popping off of it as you just smash it into kind of the dirt and the asphalt. And again, just blue light goes out, whereas now everybody, no enemies directly engaged you. But you see this one that is just [beeping resumes] and I'm assuming everyone's running.
 
00;51;03;00 - 00;51;06;10
Taylor
Am I incorrect in assuming you're getting distance on this thing?
 
00;51;07;03 - 00;51;12;04
Kit
If you're not running, you are getting, like, lassoed by one of Daf’s ribbons and pulled along.
 
00;51;13;13 - 00;51;14;27
Anna
Wait. Is this a residential area?
 
00;51;16;11 - 00;51;27;09
Taylor
It's a little bit. I mean, you're in the street, but there's like some just like it's like the residential area in which there's some houses, some apartments, but then it's like Dollar General and like grocery stores, you know, like.
 
00;51;27;26 - 00;51;40;22
Anna
Okay, I'm a I'll expend my special armor. Lark runs over to it and drops down and slices in the ground. And both her and the bomb drop into a dream. 
 
00;51;42;01 - 00;52;13;25
Taylor
Okay. You all watch as Lark disappears, the slice closing up behind her as you're left in silence. No more beeping. Belladonna, you are on the bike now. Zeke has grabbed hold of you and you can see, you know, the little visor of the helmet is is ticked up and his eyes had this flashing electricity in them, like, they looked just blue with these little flashes of electricity running through it.
 
00;52;14;04 - 00;52;39;02
Taylor
And you see almost instantly, as soon as that hole kind of closes up, that Lark has created his eyes go back to just a normal brown and as as you've always noticed and he just kind of just looks at you, doesn't really fully know what to say before just slumping again, just his head on to the back as he has just passed right back out.
 
00;52;39;02 - 00;52;51;00
Candace
I think Belladonna just kind of quietly sings to him to try and calm him and sort of just like soothe whatever kind of chaos is happening in his body.
 
00;52;51;13 - 00;53;15;14
Taylor
You know, there was still that panicked breathing that was going to happen even after he kind of lost a little bit of consciousness and he can feel it start to kind of slow down and that just grip that almost hurts kind of starts to loosen up a bit as the breathing kind of settles and you all are left waiting for Lark to show back up.
 
00;53;15;14 - 00;54;04;02
