00;00;04;22 - 00;00;15;00
Logan
You are listening to Bloom and Blight, Episode Two, Under the Surface.
 
00;00;15;00 - 00;00;45;09
Taylor
So, we will pick back up with a little bit of a time jump backwards a little bit into our day from where we left off, and see what our final team member here has been up to in the few months of fallout post, the whole incident that most everyone seems to be trying to forget or use… We'll see how this works out for everybody.
 
00;00;45;21 - 00;01;00;19
Taylor
But let's first get a description, if you could, Candace, of Lonnie and maybe what they would be doing in just a typical summer afternoon, living life.
 
00;01;02;12 - 00;01;38;11
Candace
Sure. So, Loni, that's their mundane name, she is in the process of grieving, trying to kind of figure out what to do next, how to handle these big feelings that they're wrestling with. I think if we're going to be cinematic about it, you would see an average height, kind of curvaceous build, black woman, black femme, shaved sides half their kinky, curly hair is white, the other half is black.
 
00;01;38;11 - 00;02;03;03
Candace
Up into big afro puffs. One of their eyes is crystal blue. The other one is a deep chocolate brown, stretched ears, very kind of alternative looking tattoos and things like that. And across their skin are patches of a vitiligo slightly lighter than their deeper brown complexion. They are, they kind of rock this sort of eclectic, kind of punk-tinged street style.
 
00;02;03;25 - 00;02;30;07
Candace
And I imagine when we kind of meet them, they'd probably be painting. They love painting and kind of exploring their more artistic side, and they are prone to sort of talking to herself. It's something that she kind of does idly and catches herself, especially when she's around kind of just regular people out and about, always makes her blush.
 
00;02;31;24 - 00;02;57;20
Candace
And I think, I think this one is probably a landscape, even though she's staring out at Oliva Bay, the beautiful kind of ocean there, there's almost an otherworldly color palette that she's using to create this image. It looks more kind of galaxy and kind of astral than it does like real life, even though she's absolutely capturing exactly what's in front of her.
 
00;02;57;28 - 00;03;22;23
Taylor
Awesome. I love that. Let's go ahead and just knock the knock the dust off here and can I get a roll from you, please? Just to kind of appreciate this view. And, you know, my go to would be perceive if you have that. Any points in that or if you could argue anything else in which you're trying to kind of pick out something in this this view?
 
00;03;23;13 - 00;03;41;01
Candace
Yeah, I think that I will use perceive. I don't have anything in it. Either that or express. I'd say. like Express is more about using words, but I am expressing like in my mind, I'm expressing my feelings through this painting. So, I don't know if perceive is better.
 
00;03;41;03 - 00;04;15;24
Taylor
Yeah. No, I would allow that. I would allow that for sure. Okay. So, with a five you are sitting here and in a painting in in your, your own world here a bit and something kind of catches your eye for a minute out in the water. It almost like something move, you know, movement and you think, oh, was there like  a big fish or, you know, it was big.
 
00;04;15;25 - 00;04;33;26
Taylor
It was probably: is there dolphin? Like, Oh, it's not the time for whales. Like, what was that? As you kind of see. But it seems like the water, you know, very, very quickly goes back to to a not glassy but is very calm. I feel like there's probably not a lot of breeze. It's a bay you're not having to really deal with like big waves or anything like this.
 
00;04;34;12 - 00;05;09;01
Taylor
But you kind of look and then go back to your painting and then again see something kind of move out of the corner of your eye. Look again, can't even notice really the water moving at this point and you go back to painting and then, you know, you're you're paying more attention as you see what almost looks to be just like a a light that kind of seems to pulse like a little just like a little brighter and then go back dark in this bay and it's just like under the water, just barely.
 
00;05;09;01 - 00;05;28;27
Taylor
And it looks like it just kind of a blue light goes away. Then it looks a little further away. Goes away, looks to be a little further away. Goes away. You know, you just kind of watch now as you're, you know, tracing its path and it's, you know, dark. So you're thinking probably still below the surface. A good bit, but odd,
 
00;05;28;27 - 00;05;53;24
Taylor
I mean, I'm picturing this a lot since we were talking about kind of West Coast like Monterey Bay, where it gets deep once you get out into the middle of that, like it's a big old canyon. And so it's one of those things where you're like, how far down in the water is this? And you kind of watch it for a bit, but then it seems to kind of either stop pulsing or you can't see it anymore as you're still sitting.
 
00;05;53;24 - 00;06;07;10
Taylor
And I think you do you kind of get a that just kind of a little bit of like a chill up your up your spine of of something just weird, unexplainable. You know, was that an alien kind of feeling.
 
00;06;08;06 - 00;06;41;29
Candace
I think, out loud, she says, did you did you see that? I, I don't know what that was. Yeah, but we should call the others? We should call the others. And then she takes out her phone and immediately, like, sends a group text like, hey, trying to work, caught something beneath the surface at the bay and then takes a picture and kind of uses her stylus to like illustrate like where she saw the weird thing.
 
00;06;42;17 - 00;07;06;05
Taylor
Yeah, I think you do and it's able to kind of send off and it's one of those things where, you know, you're you're you're kind of out getting this nice view a little further. The cell phone signal is a little spotty and you've clearly hit signal again, as this sends and you get like six messages pop in from earlier in the day and they're all from the same individual.
 
00;07;07;10 - 00;07;41;14
Taylor
Your friend Zeke, just a just a young, you know, college freshman, you know, kind of met, chat a bit. The first one is, is just like, hey, anything I can help you with today? Then there's like a long break, and then it's: Something's wrong. I need you to come help right now. There's a missed call at that point in time that you can kind of see comes in, and then it's just like random assortments of just button mashing, looking text after that point and then nothing.
 
00;07;42;01 - 00;07;55;08
Candace
Oh, I immediately get on my skateboard and try to either get to a bus or just hoof it back over to the Green House on campus. I know that that's where Zeke tends to be.
 
00;07;57;00 - 00;08;36;05
Taylor
All right, so we'll cut then over to a garage in the middle of town, as are three other heroes here. You all get a alert on your phone, a little group text. This is probably. Well, I guess I don't know. We'll we'll see if Vic has made his way back to the garage or is still walking. But we'll say, you know, this is probably been just about ten or 15 minutes since this kid has finally been able to, like, go to sleep and sleep off whatever has happened to him that you get this this text from Lonnie.
 
00;08;36;23 - 00;08;43;13
Kit
I think notably Lark's phone goes off. Dafs does not. Daf has muted the group chat.
 
00;08;43;24 - 00;08;53;21
Anna
Yeah I think Lark gives Daf a look at that, but checks the message. Seems like not everyone is allergic to asking for help.
 
00;08;54;08 - 00;09;12;28
Kit
Daf just, you know, kind of looks like a little bit like a kicked puppy just like, okay, no, that's fair. Yeah. But does also like check her phone knowing that this is a group chat and not something that just Lark got. I mean, we can't, we can't leave him here, can we?
 
00;09;13;12 - 00;09;20;10
Anna
No, do you think Wolfsbane would be okay if we told Belladonna to come here?
 
00;09;20;27 - 00;09;26;28
Kit
I mean, we can try to call him. I don't know if he's in a headspace to pick up his phone.
 
00;09;27;04 - 00;09;27;19
Anna
Not it!
 
00;09;29;02 - 00;09;41;04
Kit
That's fair. Sort of like glancing down, just like hoping, praying for the three dots from Wolfsbane. I'm seeing a shaking head. I'm seeing that's a no. Cool. 
 
00;09;41;15 - 00;09;51;15
Logan
Wolfsbane just had an experience for those listening, if you recall, just had an experience that he has no interest in looking at his phone, least of all, for a text message.
 
00;09;51;17 - 00;10;04;21
Kit
Cool. I think Daf will give it the good old college. Try once to call wolfsbane and like sort of give him a heads up. But if he doesn't answer the only real course of action that we have is to bring Belladonna here.
 
00;10;05;04 - 00;10;09;08
Logan
I would say he probably is not going to pick up on the first call.
 
00;10;09;13 - 00;10;10;20
Kit
You only get one.
 
00;10;10;23 - 00;10;13;11
Logan
Oh, well, sorry, sorry.
 
00;10;14;13 - 00;10;40;07
Kit
It's one of those we're kind of running out of time. And also, like, I'm not going to keep blowing up your line. If you were going to answer me, you were going to answer me. So you know we're sitting in your garage, right now, like, you know, nope you get one. And if he doesn't pick up, then I'll drop a location pin, like turn my location on and just be like, your, text Belladonna back in the group chat like, you're going to need to come here.
 
00;10;40;20 - 00;10;50;01
Taylor
Would Lonnie slash Belladonna know where this garage is? Is there going to need to be a pin sent? How open was Vic about kind of showing this place off.
 
00;10;52;20 - 00;11;14;22
Logan
Lily knew where it was. That's about it. Lily actually helped him find it and set it up because effectively, until he was who he was, he didn't know how the world worked outside of acting as a, you know, agent of evil. Whatever we want to say to that extent. So I would say this is the first time he's brought anyone here.
 
00;11;14;27 - 00;11;31;16
Taylor
So then, yeah, Lonnie, I think you will get a response back from Daf specifically that says you're going to have to come here within and address that not too terribly far from campus, but definitely not the greenhouse, which is different.
 
00;11;32;01 - 00;11;54;12
Candace
I think you get back like a bunch of like emojis that are like the question mark emoji with the exclamation mark next to it and like surprised face like a bunch of those types of deals. And then a voice message. I was on my way to the greenhouse. I've got another situation. There's there's a kid, I don't know.
 
00;11;54;12 - 00;12;05;05
Candace
We're not like super duper close, but we're friends, I guess. And he asked me for help. Something's going on with him. Is this an emergency? Do I need to come to you first?
 
00;12;05;29 - 00;12;16;01
Kit
Daf will play it out loud, obviously. So, you know, Lark I imagine here's all of that. Just sort of looks at Lark like, wellI don't know if emergency is right, but.
 
00;12;16;12 - 00;12;21;10
Anna
He did say Belladonna’s name earlier, though. It could be the same friend.
 
00;12;21;26 - 00;12;39;24
Kit
You think. Daf sort of, like, squints takes her phone out, snaps like a arguably very creepy picture of this, like, kid on the on the couch and just shoots it over to Belladonna with a text that reads, Define emergency.
 
00;12;41;00 - 00;12;42;02
Candace
So that's Zeke then?
 
00;12;43;06 - 00;13;12;06
Taylor
Yeah. You see, you see, Zeke, like still, you know, clearly his face, like, conked out, looks busted up, bruised, dirty bits of gravel in his hair. But most shockingly, his entire, both of his hands and running about halfway up his arms is just this pitch black looking something, you know, from a picture. It looks to be like it's a part of his skin.
 
00;13;12;06 - 00;13;22;00
Taylor
And you can kind of see it almost starting to like, snake its way up, kind of like a like blood poisoning would. So, clearly not that's not normal.
 
00;13;22;19 - 00;13;35;16
Candace
Yeah. I think you get back a very panicked voice memo: On my way. Don't have my bike, just my board. That's Zeke. Is he, Is he comfortable? Please keep him comfortable. I'll be there soon.
 
00;13;37;11 - 00;13;38;29
Anna
Hopefully, that'll give us some answers.
 
00;13;39;24 - 00;13;48;07
Kit
Okay. All right. Okay. I mean, at least at least she does know him and he doesn't just know her.
 
00;13;48;07 - 00;13;57;10
Anna
Yeah, I will keep an eye out the window. I guess try not to get electrocuted while you watch him.
 
00;13;57;10 - 00;14;14;03
Kit
You just get the most tired, shit eating grin like you got it dude, and just kind of go sit over by Zeke, probably just like sitting on the back of this, like, ratty couch. Zeke's like, on the actual couch and just kind of, like, perched on the back, like, the weirdest little gargoyle.
 
00;14;14;10 - 00;14;37;00
Taylor
All right, you keep an eye and, yeah, he seems to be sleeping soundly. And even as you are watching now, in just will say, you know the 20 minutes it takes for Lonnie to make it to the garage. You can see that whatever this is that had started to form a bark on him is starting to kind of crack and slough off.
 
00;14;37;00 - 00;15;09;07
Taylor
And those kind of black tendrils under his skin are starting to to recede back down and kind of not going toward the heart anymore. And so it's looking like whatever was dropped off and y'all used on him  is at least slowing it down if not reversing whatever is going wrong here. And after a bit Belladonna you come around the corner to this garage, which I don't think we fully explain kind of the outside or the surrounding areas.
 
00;15;09;25 - 00;15;14;24
Taylor
Logan, Would you like to maybe explain what it looks like and where it is kind of situated here in town?
 
00;15;14;24 - 00;15;33;05
Logan
It's a, since we're like in an a coastal area, I'm kind of picturing it's by a beach. It's where most people would keep kind of their, storage. Like they store a lot of the things that they have that they can't keep in their homes anymore. For whatever reason, they moved there in transitional periods in their lives, but he just stores his bike there.
 
00;15;33;24 - 00;15;56;12
Logan
So like you see row after row of row of like garage doors. His is very, you know, nondescript. He he does not want to be found. He doesn't want to post something on it that says Wolfsbane lives here. Get out. No, it's so outside of, you know, metal doors for the garage and like, maybe it's painted red on the outside because that's how they paint all the garages.
 
00;15;56;22 - 00;16;18;26
Logan
It's not something that you would easily point out, except for probably the number that's on it, which I don't know what number to put on it. And my brain, because I'm 12 at heart, wants to say it's 69. 420?  I could do that instead.But yeah it's, it's it's unremarkable to a to a very like it.
 
00;16;18;26 - 00;16;42;06
Logan
Well we're in a in a way we're like Clark Kent-ing it, you know, it's like too obvious to not be something that should be like it brought attention to it, but otherwise, yeah, like I said, it's by the beach. It's nondescript. The only thing that you might notice that's a little bit strange are scorch marks on the ground around it are from his bike, which, you know, has purple flames come out of it.
 
00;16;42;06 - 00;16;48;18
Logan
So every once in awhile you might see, oh, he must have ridden that way or he must have ridden the other way, because you can see the marks from there.
 
00;16;49;01 - 00;17;15;01
Taylor
You see this, I think, you know, Wolfsbane still still nowhere to be seen as of now as you can kind of, you know, pull up this garage door and peek in and you see Larkspur and Daffodil within and a now absolutely snoring Zeke on this couch inside of this kind of ratty put together, a living area in this larger garage.
 
00;17;15;07 - 00;17;16;27
Candace
And I've never been here before?
 
00;17;17;04 - 00;17;19;05
Taylor
Never. Yeah. 
 
00;17;19;29 - 00;17;31;21
Candace
Hey. What. What is this? Where is this? Why is he here? I, who who lives here? Does anyone want to fill me in or?
 
00;17;31;21 - 00;17;43;05
Anna
Well, this is Wolfbane’s. I don't think he lives here, but this was the only place we had to go. Your friend was in a bit of trouble.
 
00;17;44;07 - 00;17;45;29
Kit
Or causing a bit of trouble.
 
00;17;46;04 - 00;17;46;24
Candace
Causing?
 
00;17;47;00 - 00;17;47;12
Anna
Yeah.
 
00;17;48;13 - 00;17;50;08
Candace
No, he's sweet he’s sweet he.
 
00;17;50;10 - 00;17;52;03
Kit
Yeah, I don't think it was on purpose.
 
00;17;53;10 - 00;18;13;00
Anna
No, the vision I saw, I saw through his eyes and he couldn't control what he was doing. He was very scared and fighting very hard against it, but he caused a lot of damage. I had to be a little rough with him, but he injured Daf as well.
 
00;18;13;23 - 00;18;14;21
Candace
Daf are you okay?
 
00;18;15;06 - 00;18;40;23
Kit
I think you can see, just like with what Daf’s wearing, which is not a lot. And what it is, is spandex is is a gymnastics costume 100%. Like there's a decent sized burn over a majority of her left shoulder, but she's just sort of like sitting on the back of the couch, probably like holding one ice cold beer can to the shoulder and another one to Zeke's head. Like clearly they're both kind of having a bad time.
 
00;18;41;01 - 00;18;50;10
Kit
And she says, I'm fine. It's I'll I'll live. I'm more concerned about your friend. You you do know this guy, right?
 
00;18;50;10 - 00;19;15;04
Candace
I do. I mean, we're, we've started to be friends. I met him at the Green House. It's a long story. It was the day that was the day that we met. That I met myself. It's whatever. I he's he's good and he means well. And he always just wants to be helpful. And I feel terrible. He's going through this, like, is there anything I can do?
 
00;19;15;23 - 00;19;31;11
Kit
Daf just kind of, you know, shakes her head doesn't really kind of at a loss for like what to do at all in the situation I don't do you know is he he said he didn't do this before has he is he like us at all normally?
 
00;19;31;25 - 00;19;42;02
Candace
I don't know. That's a good question. I don't think so. But, I mean, we keep who we are very close to our chest and, maybe he does too.
 
00;19;42;14 - 00;19;55;09
Kit
Sort of a fair enough very knowing nod from Daf who is in a very shitty party city mask and has always been every time that you've met them, it's like, no, no game recognized game for sure.
 
00;19;55;26 - 00;20;12;04
Anna
We have no idea what's going on. I saw a little bit through his eyes and could tell that people are in danger. But aside from that, I haven't seen anything. This, this is all we have. There was some kind of medicine, possibly, that just showed up. We don't know where it came from.
 
00;20;12;04 - 00;20;12;23
Candace
Medicine?
 
00;20;13;05 - 00;20;20;15
Anna
You know, we don't know where it came from. But it seemed to help. It stopped him from killing Daf, at least.
 
00;20;20;22 - 00;20;21;11
Candace
Can I see it?
 
00;20;21;20 - 00;20;25;07
Kit
I mean, do you Lark, do you have the pen? Where did that go?
 
00;20;25;27 - 00;20;28;03
Anna
Yeah. I set it down over there.
 
00;20;28;21 - 00;20;46;28
Candace
Can I look at it and see if I can figure out, Like Bella is very in tune with Flowers and the greenhouse is like her favorite place. Like, that's where she kind of steeps herself the most. Would I be able to maybe tell? Like, if this is something we can make more of?
 
00;20;47;07 - 00;21;20;21
Taylor
Yes. You look at yeah this, not utensil, instrument, that's what they're called in scientific things, which looks like a casing for like an EpiPen kind of vibe. But it's a little bigger, it's a little bulkier. It's more like there's actual metal to it, you know, this glass kind of vial in the middle. Most of yeah whatever was in it has been administered already, but you're able to kind of look and see just like what looks to be just kind of this green, kind of viscous liquid that has a little bit of a glow to it.
 
00;21;20;21 - 00;21;50;03
Taylor
And just like the couple of drops that are left, actually, I think would say even I’ll kind of give you this one for free. You're looking at it and it very clearly looks unnatural. It very clearly doesn't look just even as of a normal medicine with having kind of this glow to it. And you can almost kind of catch a little bit what looks to be like some sort of little specks in it that seem to kind of like move and flicker and kind of make that green hue, that glow, to it.
 
00;21;50;03 - 00;21;54;17
Candace
Does the glow at all look like the glow that I saw beneath the water?
 
00;21;54;17 - 00;22;04;24
Taylor
It doesn't. I'll say.. Yeah. Yeah. The the one that you kind of saw in the water is a little more blue. And it seemed like from a big source, you know? Okay.
 
00;22;05;10 - 00;22;18;03
Candace
I have no idea what this is. There's little things inside. I guess we just need to watch him. Did you get my text? I saw something at the Bay. Also where is Wolfsbane?
 
00;22;18;17 - 00;22;19;04
Anna
Moping.
 
00;22;20;16 - 00;23;02;26
Logan
I will say at that point you can you can hear the roaring of his bike as he comes around back to his garage. I've just I've just decided this. My bike's name is Cerberus because that's badass and cool and I have a wolves motif, so. But you can hear the bike come back and just as you ask where he is, you can see him slam the door, FUCK. And he just like he sees all three of you and he just sits on the couch, not sitting on Zeke, but like moves him and
 
00;23;02;26 - 00;23;10;24
Logan
Just sits on the couch. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. And he just kind of keeps on. It's his mantra right now.
 
00;23;11;07 - 00;23;12;16
Anna
New problems, or old?
 
00;23;12;29 - 00;23;18;10
Candace
Did you also see the the glowing? Did you did you see it too? Is that why you're so agitated?
 
00;23;19;16 - 00;23;25;29
Logan
No. Fuck up fucking they’re back, they’re back, they’re fucking back, they’re back, they’re fucking they’re 
 
00;23;25;29 - 00;23;26;10
Candace
Back.
 
00;23;26;10 - 00;23;47;17
Logan
Them the you know the the ones that made me they’re they're back. They're here. They're, they, they talked to me. He, he points to the, the vial that's in Belladonna’s hand. They made that, that fucking thing. It's probably poison. I don't know. But they're fucking back.
 
00;23;48;12 - 00;23;51;02
Candace
Oh. So this does not help anyone.
 
00;23;51;02 - 00;24;00;08
Logan
I don't know what. She gave it to me. She just. She dropped it off. I don't know what she's doing. I don't know why she's. She's messing with my head. I don't.
 
00;24;00;08 - 00;24;15;03
Kit
Oh, if they if if it's the people who made you and it's the people who made that, are you thinking that they have also made him?
 
00;24;15;22 - 00;24;34;18
Logan
I don't know that they didn't turn people, and maybe he's not the person like me. Maybe he's something else. Maybe he's I don't know. But they normally just make us. They just make us. And then we're here. He looks at Belladonna, because he heard him say her name, and he looks and goes, How long have you known him?
 
00;24;35;18 - 00;24;40;05
Candace
Since I don't. Since the joining.
 
00;24;40;05 - 00;24;41;11
Logan
So before you knew me.
 
00;24;41;17 - 00;24;45;11
Candace
Yes. But I mean know is kind of a loose term. We're not.
 
00;24;45;27 - 00;25;14;18
Logan
Yeah. Okay. I just need a timeline. If they made him before they made me, that would explain why I don't know anything about him, but I don't I don't know, some kid. And Wolfsbane kind of just like he is lost, and clearly terrified that something is coming back to hurt him, and and you I guess, all of you, you can kind of see the fear and you he kind of go silent and mutters
 
00;25;14;18 - 00;25;16;03
Logan
under his breath. Fuck.
 
00;25;17;04 - 00;25;22;09
Candace
We'll figure it out. We won't let them get you. When you're among friends, you know you can't really lose.
 
00;25;22;21 - 00;25;28;22
Logan
'm not worried about me. I'm worried that they're back after what happened.
 
00;25;28;22 - 00;25;31;10
Anna
This was supposed to be over, after Lily.
 
00;25;32;01 - 00;25;39;07
Candace
Without Lily, it can never be over. I know what you mean. I'm sorry. I don't mean to get, we've been in our feelings today.
 
00;25;39;18 - 00;25;45;16
Logan
You have no idea. Well, are we all just going to live in my garage? What's the game plan?
 
00;25;46;02 - 00;25;51;06
Anna
I mean, we have the hide out, but can we bring Zeke to it?
 
00;25;51;06 - 00;25;56;15
Kit
You said they're back. Did. Did you lose them? Did I mean, they know where we’re
 
00;25;56;23 - 00;25;57;01
Logan
They.
 
00;25;57;01 - 00;25;58;24
Kit
At? Yeah, they brought it.
 
00;25;59;04 - 00;26;06;20
Logan
So this isn't safe. I'm going have to find a new garage. Well, they'll probably just find that. Is the hideout even safe? Is anywhere even safe?
 
00;26;07;12 - 00;26;12;01
Anna
The hideout is at least secure. You can only get in specific ways.
 
00;26;12;29 - 00;26;13;10
Logan
Yeah.
 
00;26;13;22 - 00;26;14;26
Kit
That's fair enough.
 
00;26;15;04 - 00;26;15;19
Logan
Okay.
 
00;26;16;01 - 00;26;24;16
Kit
I mean, I don't. Belladonna, you know, this guy arguably better than any of us. I assume I can. We trust him in the hideout?
 
00;26;24;27 - 00;26;42;29
Candace
He's a good kid. And I think if we blindfold him and make sure that he can't see where we're going, that if he wakes up there, we at least know he'll fight whatever this is inside of him and won’t just give in easily. I can probably keep him calm. Having a familiar face might help.
 
00;26;43;22 - 00;26;51;13
Kit
That's fair. I mean, I hate to tie the kid up and blindfold him, but we can make that happen, I guess.
 
00;26;51;20 - 00;26;57;25
Candace
I mean, he trusts me. If I tell him we had no choice, I think he'll understand.
 
00;26;58;19 - 00;27;03;03
Anna
I can go and get the flowers if you all want to meet me over there.
 
00;27;03;17 - 00;27;13;10
Logan
Okay, let's. Let's get out of here. They at least know where we are. And that means they could get to us in any moment. And I don't like it. My skin is going to crawl off my own.
 
00;27;14;07 - 00;27;25;23
Candace
From one bike rider to another. Can you be a little bit careful? It was so easy to find this place and know that you are here with all of those tire marks all over the front.
 
00;27;26;05 - 00;27;28;22
Kit
Is less flames an option?
 
00;27;28;22 - 00;27;39;08
Candace
Please. I don't have room for him on my board. You're going to have to take him with you. Unless you know Daf, Larkspur, you have room somewhere for him.
 
00;27;39;08 - 00;27;40;26
Kit
I mean, on my shoulders I guess.
 
00;27;40;26 - 00;27;47;03
Logan
 I'll take him on my bike. He'll be fine. Don't worry about it. I can carry people.
 
00;27;47;16 - 00;27;50;22
Kit
Can we set the flames to, to low?
 
00;27;50;23 - 00;27;52;27
Logan
You think there's, like, a dial here? It's just.
 
00;27;52;28 - 00;27;58;24
Kit
I don't. I don't know. I don't claim to understand how your bike works. I don't drive that.
 
00;27;59;17 - 00;28;00;25
Logan
Listen, I don't.
 
00;28;01;03 - 00;28;06;24
Candace
Maybe just. Maybe just pull over before you get to the hideout and walk the bike in if you need to.
 
00;28;07;03 - 00;28;10;12
Kit
 Park it in a bush, you know, down the side of the hill, right.
 
00;28;10;18 - 00;28;11;06
Candace
Something.
 
00;28;11;24 - 00;28;13;08
Logan
Okay, you know what? Well.
 
00;28;13;18 - 00;28;14;07
Kit
It's a good bike.
 
00;28;14;07 - 00;28;16;13
Candace
This is not a criticism. I love it. It's wonderful. Just, you know.
 
00;28;16;13 - 00;28;22;07
Logan
I feel like there's a lot of focus right now on my bike and not a lot of focus on us going. So…  
00;28;22;07 - 00;28;28;10
Kit
That's the problem is that there's so much focus on the bike. That's that's what we're trying to avoid is that is the is the focus on the on the bike.
 
00;28;28;22 - 00;28;34;01
Logan
I understand. I get it. I'll be I'll go into stealth mode. Ended up less flames less.
 
00;28;34;01 - 00;28;35;13
Kit
I knew you had stealth mode.
 
00;28;35;14 - 00;28;46;27
Logan
But that was that was a I was I was humoring you. There's no way, it's a bike powered by magic. I can't make it less noticeable.
 
00;28;47;08 - 00;28;47;28
Kit
Well, we tried.
 
00;28;48;08 - 00;28;49;28
Logan
Don't worry about it. It'll be fine. Things will be fine.
 
00;28;49;28 - 00;28;58;12
Candace
Donnie will work on something. They're going to be tinkering about this all day. And she kind of like taps her her forehead, like. Stop.
 
00;28;58;21 - 00;29;05;18
Anna
Daf, you don't have a vehicle. Do you want to come with me? Or are you following them on foot?
 
00;29;06;16 - 00;29;11;19
Kit
I mean, if they don't need my help, just sort of like looks at Wolfsbane and Belladonna.
 
00;29;11;26 - 00;29;16;04
Logan
I'm just going to put them on my bike. There's not enough room for more than two people. 
00;29;16;10 - 00;29;21;11
Candace
You can ride on my longboard with me if you want to come. I mean, I never don't need you.
 
00;29;21;13 - 00;29;37;09
Kit
I think. I think I would just crowd the board. My sic flips, end once I'm on wheels, yeah, they'll just sort of, like, have a half a smile, like, yeah, I'll help grab the flowers. That's fine.
 
00;29;37;21 - 00;30;01;04
Logan
I'll go ahead and I'll go ahead and get the kid on my bike and Wolfsbane will go up, grab the kid easily, put them over his shoulder and just start walking. Takes a quick look at his garage and sighs. I was just starting to like this place. Okay. And I'll put them on. I'll give him my helmet. I'll ride without my own helmet.
 
00;30;01;04 - 00;30;16;09
Logan
He'll he'll carry it. They'll look less less suspicious as we're driving on the highway, you know, like the person on the back isn't just knocked out. So it like, doesn’t look like I'm kidnaping someone? But yeah, I'll just like, I'll see you all at the hide out. And he just gets Cerberus ready and…
 
00;30;16;09 - 00;30;30;28
Taylor
Before you take off real quick, before you take off, you get him on the bike and you're looking back at your garage. What is a moment that you've had in this garage that stands out to you, with Lily?
 
00;30;32;12 - 00;30;55;00
Logan
Probably the most prominent moment is her showing him the garage and for the first time in his entire life, he's had his own private space. And her giving that to him, I mean, she didn't like give it to him. Obviously, she showed it and helped him find it. But it's that moment, that realization that, oh, no one has to know,
 
00;30;55;00 - 00;30;59;20
Logan
doesn't have to know where this is? No one has to bother me? It's my own.
 
00;31;00;12 - 00;31;13;24
Taylor
I think that the day when you were able to finally kind of move in to this this garage, have it be your own, how long, how long ago do you think that would have been? What is the timeline on Vic kind of joining the crew?
 
00;31;13;25 - 00;31;24;01
Logan
I would say it was like 4 to 5 months, not not long, but like not recent anymore, you know, enough that maybe I feel like I've always been part of the team even though I haven't.
 
00;31;24;08 - 00;31;45;07
Taylor
Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, we see Lily, you know, few months back in in just her day to day form. She always went by Lily with y'all. If there was a kind of mundane name that she gave up, you wouldn’t  know it. As it was always just Lily. You see her standing there, you know, in front of the garage door.
 
00;31;45;08 - 00;32;09;08
Taylor
She's kind of pulled it open for you as you've you've pulled up, and she's standing there with a, like Tada, kind of like Vanna White arms going on. You see, She's kind of tanner. More tanned skin, but very freckled. Has these just like, golden eyes that just kind of pop. Her hair is like bright pink and orange and, like, little pompom, like, puffs on her head just like this
 
00;32;09;08 - 00;32;27;19
Taylor
Just wild, crazy, fun colors. I think she's standing there and just probably just like some ripped jeans and like an equally bright pink shirt, you know, just very like casual converse. I feel like that that feels like the vibe to, like, white, the blue jeans and the bright, you know, everything. Just very, very bright, very fun, very light, very happy.
 
00;32;27;20 - 00;32;47;22
Taylor
And yeah, she's kind of like the little tada of now the inside of this is furnished. It is what you have it furnished with currently, but it was not previously. And she’s just like, it's the best I could find, honestly, you know, I didn't feel like new things you would really be happy with. Also, I didn't want to work extra hours.
 
00;32;47;22 - 00;32;52;03
Taylor
I'm sorry but, Facebook marketplace, great finds right?
 
00;32;53;24 - 00;32;56;19
Logan
What's, I don't, I don't know what that is.
 
00;32;57;05 - 00;32;59;16
Taylor
It's a rabbit hole you don’t want to go down. It's fine.  
00;33;00;20 - 00;33;02;29
Logan
Okay. So this is mine?
 
00;33;03;18 - 00;33;04;08
Taylor
All yours.
 
00;33;05;28 - 00;33;08;01
Logan
Umm? What do I do with it?
 
00;33;08;16 - 00;33;29;17
Taylor
I, I mean, I guess whatever you want, really. I didn't know what you needed for that, points to the bike, so didn't get you any of those things, but you can probably work on that over there. Got a TV, a radio, I don't know if people use those anymore, but you got one. So you could just listen to things 


Logan
Like what?
 
00;33;29;17 - 00;33;32;19
Taylor
Let's go back to the TV. You could watch shows.
 
00;33;33;06 - 00;33;33;23
Logan
Like what?
 
00;33;34;03 - 00;33;44;29
Taylor
Oh, okay. Let's see, what would be your vibe? There's one show, really a lot of seasons, dark and kind of brooding, like you are, Supernatural. Have you heard of that?
 
00;33;46;25 - 00;33;49;11
Logan
I I've been called supernatural before.
 
00;33;49;17 - 00;33;50;13
Taylor
I think you'll love it.
 
00;33;50;14 - 00;33;51;00
Logan
Okay.
 
00;33;51;03 - 00;34;11;05
Taylor
It's on Netflix. I'll log it in Anyway. I just. Look, I felt like you needed a place to call your own. You'll figure out whatever you may do to fill your time here. I don't know. Maybe invite me over. We could hang out. I don't know. Maybe invite the other team members? Friends, to come hang out.
 
00;34;11;12 - 00;34;23;12
Logan
Let's put a pin on that. But yeah, you coming over would be nice. I, do I need to tell you what I did, while I'm here? Do I have to, like, log that?
 
00;34;23;18 - 00;34;38;11
Taylor
No, please don't. I don't really want to know. Honestly. Just whatever pops in your head of like, Hey, I want to do this. You can, as long as it's probably not like killing or hurting people or like breaking laws, because that's going to be a lot to have to clean up and talk about later.
 
00;34;38;19 - 00;34;43;14
Logan
I won't kill or hurt someone who doesn't try to hurt or kill other people.
 
00;34;43;22 - 00;35;02;27
Taylor
Valid. That's a good line. I also put some water in the fridge, some food there. It's all set up and oh, great, hold on. And she'll like go over to a box and like pull out a vase and like sits it on the middle of the table and puts a little bouquet of lilies in it. Like, now it’s home, right?
 
00;35;03;20 - 00;35;31;19
Logan
Vic is trying hard, very hard not to well up with emotions. But the biggest problem that he has is he's never had the capability until very recently when he has changed because again, Vic was once a monstrous creature who has been made human. And we don't think about it so much like on your day to day, but realize children have this time to recognize emotions and how to properly process them.
 
00;35;31;23 - 00;35;55;04
Logan
Vic has not had that time. He might have had the mentality to understand, like, this is anger, this is joy. But he doesn't know what that all feels like. So Vic is just kind of standing there looking a little tense, a little angry, but you can see little like tears starting to form in his eyes. And he just kind of looks at Lily and goes, Thank you.
 
00;35;55;25 - 00;36;01;05
Logan
I really appreciate this. I feel like I owe you something, but I don't know what.
 
00;36;01;13 - 00;36;04;14
Taylor
How about a hug? Are we there yet?
 
00;36;05;07 - 00;36;15;24
Logan
Oh, okay. He just kind of awkwardly opens his arms and, like, walks stiffly over. Okay, what's the next thing I do?
 
00;36;15;24 - 00;36;28;03
Taylor
Okay, okay. Okay. Do you, Do you want me to to to start the hug? 
Logan
That's okay. That's okay. Mm hmm. 
Taylor
Okay. I'm going to close my right arm. 
Logan
Yeah.
Taylor
 Okay. And now the other.
 
00;36;28;12 - 00;36;28;27
Logan
Okay.
 
00;36;29;09 - 00;36;30;03
Taylor
Okay, now you do the same.
 
00;36;30;06 - 00;36;30;16
Logan
Okay?
 
00;36;31;18 - 00;36;32;00
Taylor
Mm hmm.
 
00;36;32;15 - 00;36;32;28
Logan
That's it?
 
00;36;33;11 - 00;36;39;27
Taylor
This is it. This is a hug. We're hugging right now. Yeah. You give a little squeeze, like. Oh, yeah. And then that then then that's it.
 
00;36;40;04 - 00;36;43;02
Logan
Yeah, that was a lot. You're unusually strong for your size.
 
00;36;43;14 - 00;36;47;11
Taylor
I am. I really am. And she'll kind of pull back a sorry, I forget my own strength.
 
00;36;47;15 - 00;36;52;08
Logan
Okay, that was different. That was weird. I think I'm feeling things. I don't know what they are yet.
 
00;36;52;29 - 00;37;04;00
Taylor
You. Hey, you can process those in your brand new garage. Do you want me to stay or, like, leave? What would help this processing situation better?
 
00;37;04;00 - 00;37;08;28
Logan
Um, can we just sit and, like, exist together? 
 
00;37;09;11 - 00;37;33;13
Taylor
Yeah. Absolutely. Just, like, immediately plops down onto the couch, and we flash forward to Vic in real time. Kind of like reliving this memory and kind of feeling those emotions bubble over when you notice the vase that's still sitting there, probably some dead lilies from the last time she put it in, kind of like hanging over the edge. But there is one brand new one, right in the middle of the vase.
 
00;37;34;00 - 00;37;58;22
Logan
Did I put that there? 
Taylor
Nope. 
Logan
Vic is very confused, having not had the time to process what's going on and noticing that, but looks at it. They're just trying to mess with me. They're all just trying to mess with me. Okay, I'm out of here. And he revs up the engine and all pretenses of being stealthy are gone and the flames burn brightly and he zooms off with Zeke in tow.
 
00;37;58;29 - 00;38;22;04
Taylor
Belladonna was following after on the board, right? Just heading straight to the hideout as well. All right, so you're you're you're following behind. It's pretty easy to to keep a general track. I mean, you can't keep up, but you are able to kind of follow follow your way easy enough as you'll head to the hideout. 
 
00;38;22;04 - 00;38;24;21
Taylor
For then Daf and Lark, y'all are going to the gardening club?
 
00;38;25;00 - 00;38;25;17
Anna
Yes.
 
00;38;25;28 - 00;38;41;01
Kit
I believe so, quick, though, before we like, dip from the garage for potentially ever. Wolfsbane are there any like posters or anything on the wall like any sort of trinkets?
 
00;38;41;21 - 00;38;58;03
Logan
The closest that Wolfsbane would have for like personal affects. Honestly, they’re so far and few, it's probably something that he stores on his bike or on his person. Like he can't. He hasn't, like, really figured out what it means to have a personal thing, to have like, something that's just his alone.
 
00;38;58;07 - 00;39;30;21
Kit
Oh, well, now I'm crying. Because she's, unbeknownst to most of the group, Daf has bounced from home to home a lot in the past. And she knows that, you know, it's it's tough to leave everything behind, but sometimes you got to kind of pick and choose. But it is good to have some sort of consistency. So if she can find some sort of small like carry able object and maybe it is just that radio, maybe there isn't like a poster like a pop figure or something, but something like that that she would take with her to the hideout just so that he could have some consistent item.
 
00;39;30;26 - 00;39;36;08
Logan
Kind of a question for the director. How famous or popular is Bloom in this world?
 
00;39;36;19 - 00;39;40;26
Taylor
Was very, or at least in this town and like surrounding areas.
 
00;39;40;26 - 00;39;43;02
Logan
Would there have been figures made of us?
 
00;39;43;06 - 00;39;45;19
Taylor
Oh, absolutely.
 
00;39;46;01 - 00;39;47;29
Logan
Then Vic has a Lily figure. Absolutely.
 
00;39;48;28 - 00;39;49;18
Kit
Stop it.
 
00;39;49;18 - 00;39;50;28
Taylor
Oh, yes.
 
00;39;51;08 - 00;40;14;03
Kit
I mean, so it's probably that and like I think Daf is a little bit like sort of teary eyed realizing that like, no, that's that is the quote unquote personal effect. That is grabable. Then she'll just kind of, you know, take a second, kind of like look it over and be like, okay, that hurts more than I thought it was going to, and tosses it in her gym bag and turns to Lark like, All right, let's do this thing.
 
00;40;14;24 - 00;40;17;07
